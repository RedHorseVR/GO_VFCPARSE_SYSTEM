### Soon to do

* handle inks in comments: https://tip.golang.org/doc/comment, not support lists and headers
  * not handle [otherModulePkg.Name]
  * try to handle [sameModulePkg.Name] and [Name]
  * handle [XYZ] + [XYZ]: link
  * handle bare urls.

* show alias list for types, or identical tyoe list

* show id ref counts, and ref counts should affect populirities.

* add a debug flag, help users collect info

* details page: add a "+" before package, click it to show parent (and module root) packages
  * if a package doesn't belongs the module, italic it.

* use different default flag values for gocore, godoge and golds

* js: auto link "golang.org/x/..." etc.

* add a "typ" page kind, for unnamed types, because unnamed types don't belong to any packages.
  * now functions are not listed as values of
    type NetworkProtocolFactory func(*Stack) NetworkProtocol
    Maybe it is good to not list, but need a way to find these values.

  * info on this page (same as a defined type)
    * aliases of the type
    * underlied types
    * uses places
    * ...

* now, not collect uses for unnamed struct type fields.
  In the following code, only collect for x1 and y1
    var a struct {
      x int
      y struct {
        m bool
      }
    }
    use a fake type alias named with its hash for the struct type? 
    So that the nested field could be used in ref page urls.
    
    example: golang.zx2c4.com/wireguard/device.Device
    
    only do this when --source-code-reading=rich
    
* trace nested field: aPkg.Device.net.port for ref pages.
  Not a good solution! This problen should be the same as the last one.
  We need to use a fake type alias to "struct{port uint16}"
  and use "theAlias.port" to denote the ref id.
  
	type Device struct {
		net struct {
			port          uint16 // listening port
		}
	}

* the handling of "removeOriginalIdent" in output docs is not very reasonable

* golds gopath

* id introduced in version: 1.15-, 1.16, 1.17, ...
* check "Deprecated: " in comments

* generics
  * use https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/typeparams ?
  * click a type param, highlight all its refs in package details package
    * id hightlight in source code optimization: enclose each function in a div
      or each function is a hight scope unit: multiple highlighting
      * Note: a function literal might be enclosed in a package-level type spec.
  * for generic type/function, list its instances
  * for generic type, list values of each its instance
  * method implementation
    * method prototypes without or with TypeParam:
      whether or not list instanced methods
  * type implementations
    * types whose method prototypes without or with TypeParam:
      whether or not list instanced types
  * check d.forbidRegisterTypes voilations by generic code

* pure terminal mode

  * GOOS, ....: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44356

* dep page: list the importing source files.

* tests only work for Linux now.

* one-page doc for private packages: https://github.com/go101/golds/issues/19

* seperate comment and code in reading: https://github.com/go101/golds/issues/21

* pkg details page: show values by file/position order (only for javascript on)
* search ids on pkg details/overview pages

* hotley: HOME - to overview page.
  * in gen code, weite a hidden element which text is the overview page relative url.

* embed playground
  * to run examples

* The following function should be shown in the AsOutputOf lists of the Option and renderer.Option types.
   func WithXHTML() interface{Option; renderer.Option}
  * similarly for AsInputOf lists

* implicit
  * switch expr := srcNode.(type) { // this expr might need to be enclosed in mutilple labels
    case T1: _ = expr
    case T2: _ = expr
    }
* now, for "type T struct {m sync.Mutex}", "var t T", "t.m.Lock" will be registered to "sync.Mutex.Lock",
  instead of "T.Lock()"
* s = StructTypeFoo{} // unkeyed struct assignment should be viewed as full-keyed assignment: need recored in uses lists.


* type alias and same-underlyings list
  * https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44905

* show more values in type-of lists
  * type F func(), then list all "func xxx()" for type F
  * type S []T, then list all "[]T" values for type S (ex. image/color.Palette, list image/color.[]color.Color values)
  * list all values of implementors of an interface type I for I
  * ...

* stat: keyword use count: most implemented interface.

* also grey the same parts in asInputsOf/.... lists

* uses page filter: declartions | value destination | value source | in std | out of std
  * writes includes (v=x, field:x, and Struct{x}, ...)
  * as Type, as Field (for embedding field)

* move most readme content to go101.org.
  * keep case table, simple install, simple feature overview, simple usage (golds std, golds ./...)

* use "go.lds" config file for docs generation.
  * -use-config=true and -config=go.lds for -gen defaultly 
  * or use comment lines in go.mod (not recommended):
    // golds -nouses ./... # configX
    // golds -only-list-exporteds -source-code-reading=external ./... # configY

* some functions are called in .s files, ..., uses pages miss them

* code page: each function enclosed in a span so that local id hightlighting needs less time.
* reduce code page size
  * some buildIdentifier -> buildLink
  * use short class names: codeline => l
  * use short tag names
  * no need to <code></code> in each code line.
  * no need <span class="codeline", use pre > code > span in css instead.
  * replace \t\t\t with margin-left

* use css chart instead of svg? https://chartscss.org/

* css style
  * https://github.com/go101/golds/issues/13#issuecomment-769154192
    bigger font maybe. Matching the font at https://golang.org/pkg/ (Roboto 16px, 1.3em line height)
* enhance tests
  * test by ast comments
* add more comments, and clear some

* show statistics floating on the right of the overview page.

* use tree view for overview page to show modules.




* add "dâžœ" in overview page: hover on a package: show its brief intro.
* more hovers:
  * in code, show tooltip as the full selector path for shortened selectors.

* now, there is not a way to view the uses of embedded fields (control+click?)

* add a button on overview page to do static analysis

* -format=[html|json|txt|md]

* show which packages are CVS dirty in overview page.



* uses pages: show package reference list (for example, find all unsafe uses)
* id uses need consider whether or not the id is promoted.
  For promoted selectors, the receiver arg's type must be checked
  Need an option on page: check the owner type of selectors or not.
* uses pages: also count some implicit uses, such as unkeyed struct literals
* show identifier uses: use fake ids for some cases
  * unnamed types ([192]uint64, []*debug/dwarf.TypedefType, ...)
  * string literals
  * fields of package-level unnamed structs (current no ways to represent as TypeName.field, need a fake typename)
    * even for named types, its files obtained by embedding have not definitions, so now uses are not collected for them
  * methods of unnamed stricts (obtained by embedding, now uses are not collected for them)
  * filter: only show those in type specifications
  * // ToDo: the above code works for the "bar" and "baz" fields, but not for the "X" field.
				//
				// type Foo struct {
				// 	bar Type
				//	baz struct {
				//		X int
				//	}
				//}
				//
				// There are two ways to solve this problem:
				// 1. create a fake type name "unamed-12345" and use "unamed-12345.X" to denote the X field.
				// 2. modify ref-user page implementation to support "Foo.baz.X" (not recommended, may have loop problem).


* some buildPageHref can make page != nil
    and buildPageHref should be a method of DocServer
    add a Pkg field for pagePathInfo to optimize?
  
* use js to fold functions in code pages
  * use js to fold interface method implementations
* use js to check input in :target in onload, expend it if applicable
* add ol=nn,nn querystring to source page: srcpage?#line-nnn&cols=nn,nn+mm,mm
  so that JS can hightlight the identifier. Multiple id instances might exist in one line
* use cookie to remember options: show-unexporteds, sort-by

* field list: align them as which in code. But need to consider embedding chain...

* calculate value importance:
  * result/param type popularity matter
  * number of uses matter

* about https://github.com/go101/golds/issues/9 and to avoid depings affecting depeds' docs:
  * need to implement the module aware features firstly.
    https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal
  * std packages are in a std module
  * note: the dependencies of modules can be bidirectional
  * within a module: allow mutual references  
    for two packages not in the same module, only deping can reference deped.
  * assume v1.x.y doesn;t break v1.m.n (where x.y > m.n)
  * this is a hard problem without solutions. Close this issue?
    It is a problem which looks simple but actually hard intrinsicly.
    Golds deffers from godoc in that Golds generated docs of a packages depends on the packages depend on it.
    Mention docs size could be reduced much by using -source-code-reading=external. 

* modify the cache system to only cache most visited and recent ones

* method docs 
  * how to handle duplicated methods caused by interface embedding interfaces.
    Their docs might be different.

* rate limit http requests. 1000requests/3600seconds

* server state:
  * highlight id 0-n
  * searching uses for id goroutine 0-n
  (forget what these means)



* overview page: show std pkgages only
  * need maintain a seperated depHeight/depDepth for std module internally.

* search (non-semantic search, pure word searching)
  * ref: https://github.com/g-harel/gothrough

* gen mode: merge docs for several (GOOS, GOARCH) compositions. At least for std.


* Rewrite some implemenrations
  * global.pacakgeList, each pkg has a unique id (int32)
  * global.functionProtoypes, each has a unique id (int32)
  * global.identifierList, each has unique id
  * global.selectorNameIds {pkgId, identId int32}
  * global.methodPrototypes {selNameId, funcProtoId}, each correspods a unique id (int32(
  * global.method2typesTable map[methodProtoId][]*type. All the []*type share a common big []*type slice.
    The length of the big slice is sum(type[i].methodCount)

### 1.0 milestore must do

* remove Golds version from footer to avoid modifying all pages when using a new golds version.
* custom styles and support godoc style

### More to do

* graphics
  * show dep relations
    * filter: within a module or project

	  lsif-c++ for cgo etc.

* list .md files and render markdown files

* use css fixate the top file path bar.

* special handling for the buitlin page, 
  // * make(Type ChannelKind|MapKind|SliceKind, sizes ...int) Type
  //   Type must denote a channel, map, or slice type.
  //   make(Type ChannelKind|MapKind|SliceKind, size integer) Type
  //   Type must denote a channel, map, or slice type.
  //   size must be a non-negative integer value (of any integer type) or a literal denoting a non-negative integer value.
  //   make(Type SliceKind, length integer, capacity interger) Type
  //   Type must denote a slice type.
  //   length and capacity must be both non-negative integer values (of any integer type) or literals denoting a non-negative integer values.
  //   The types of length and capacity may be different.
  // * new(Type AnyKind) *Type
  // * each with simple examples


* module info
